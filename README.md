## 🔧 Highlighted projects

Here are some representative projects from my repositories.  
(You can turn these into links by wrapping the repo name with `[name](url)`.)

- Bondly – A **Django-based social platform** showcasing clean architecture, reusable apps, and production-ready auth/feed flows.[attached_file:1]  
- Translator – **LangChain + LangGraph-powered AI translator** that converts any language to **Nagamese**, with a modular RAG-style pipeline and tool-calling oriented design.[attached_file:1]  
- RAG Backend – **GenAI backend service** built with Python, LangChain, and vector DBs, exposing REST APIs for document ingestion, retrieval, and chat-style querying.[attached_file:1]  
- ChartCraft – **FastAPI + Highcharts** backend that accepts user-defined payloads and returns dynamic chart configurations, designed for analytics dashboards and BI-style integrations.[attached_file:1]  
- Golang microservices – A set of **Go-based REST and gRPC services** and utilities that explore microservice patterns, structured logging, and container-first design.[attached_file:1]  
- fastapi-tyre-classification – A **FastAPI service for ML classification** (tyre-related use case) that wraps a trained model behind clean, documented endpoints.[attached_file:1]  
- resume_parser – A **resume parsing backend** that extracts key candidate information for HR/ATS-style workflows; built to be extended with custom NLP/LLM logic.[attached_file:1]  
- ChatBotAI – A **chatbot backend** experimenting with LLM integration, conversational flows, and API-first design.[attached_file:1]

## 🧩 What I enjoy working on

- Designing **API-first backends** that are easy to scale, observe, and maintain.  
- Building **GenAI / RAG systems** that combine LLMs with vector search, graph-style retrieval, and robust tool/use-case orchestration.  
- Experimenting with **system design**, **event-driven architectures**, and **data-intensive applications**.
